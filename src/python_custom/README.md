# house G - Original climate controller

This directory contains the initial/original climate controller scripts and data-files that were in use for climate control at house G in the first few years. Climate control was done through MS-Excel compatible CSV files.
This setup has been replaced by an openhab based system (with a number of webbased GUIs).
