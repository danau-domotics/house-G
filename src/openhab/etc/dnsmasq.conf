# Configuration file for dnsmasq (adapted for Scorpio Climate Access Point mode).
# This file is only used when dnsmasq is used, not when isc-dhcp-server is used.

# See "/usr/sbin/dnsmasq --help" or "man 8 dnsmasq" for details.

# Never forward plain names (without a dot or domain part)
# domain-needed
# Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.
# bogus-priv
# Filter useless windows-originated DNS requests.

# Use the hosts file more extensively.

# Change this line if you want dns to get its upstream servers from
# somewhere other that /etc/resolv.conf
#resolv-file=

# Don't attempt to do any resolving beyond what can be found in local
# configuration files.

# If you don't want dnsmasq to poll /etc/resolv.conf or other resolv

listen-address=192.168.160.10

# On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard address,
# even when it is listening on only some interfaces. It then discards
# requests that it shouldn't reply to. This has the advantage of
# working even when interfaces come and go and change address. If you
# want dnsmasq to really bind only the interfaces it is listening on,
# uncomment this option. About the only time you may need this is when
# running another nameserver on the same machine.

# Set the DHCP server to authoritative mode. In this mode it will barge in
# and take over the lease for any client which broadcasts on the network,
# whether it has a record of the lease or not. This avoids long timeouts
# when a machine wakes up on a new network. DO NOT enable this if there's
# the slightest chance that you might end up accidentally configuring a DHCP
# server for your campus/company accidentally. The ISC server uses
# the same option, and this URL provides more information:

# Set the DHCP server to enable DHCPv4 Rapid Commit Option per RFC 4039.
# In this mode it will respond to a DHCPDISCOVER message including a Rapid Commit
# option with a DHCPACK including a Rapid Commit option and fully committed address
# and configuration information. This must only be enabled if either the server is 
# the only server for the subnet, or multiple servers are present and they each
# commit a binding for all clients.
